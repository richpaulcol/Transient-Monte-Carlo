# Transient-Monte-Carlo

This is the code beign developed to run Probabilistic Modelling of Transients in Water Distribution Systems. This is one of a number of code developements as part of the Probabilisitic Transient Propagation Research Project funded by EPSRC (EP/N027507/1), http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/N027507/1
